Python is a multi-paradigm programming language, meaning it supports multiple programming styles, including both object-oriented and functional programming.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Python fully supports OOP, allowing you to create classes, objects, and use principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. You can define classes, create objects, and manage state and behavior using methods.

- **Functional Programming (FP):** Python also supports functional programming features like first-class functions, higher-order functions, and built-in functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`. You can write pure functions, use recursion, and leverage features like lambda functions, though Python is not purely functional.

You can mix both paradigms in Python, which makes it a versatile and flexible language for various types of programming tasks.
